You need to pass all tables required by `collatz_step` as keyword arguments of `pw.iterate`. In general, `pw.iterate` can return a single table, a tuple or a named tuple of tables. It depends on what is returned from the user-defined function passed to `pw.iterate`. In this case, the `collatz_step` returns a single table and that's why `pw.iterate` also returns a single table.\n",

The `iteration_limit` argument of `pw.iterate` was not set. That's why the computation continues until records stop updating. If the Collatz conjecture was not true for these numbers, the computation would not finish. Fortunately, it has finished, and this way we checked that it is true at least for these three numbers. You can check more numbers if you wish but don't expect anything fancy as all numbers up to $2^{69}$ have been [checked already](http://www.ericr.nl/wondrous/).\n",

It is a necessary step that allows Pathway to say that nothing has changed. The `pw.iterate` can only stop if there is no change in some iteration. If there was no change in one iteration, there won't be changes in any further iterations (functions passed to `iterate` should be deterministic to avoid problems)."

Let's consider polynomials of the form $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Note that you can convert any third-degree polynomial for the purpose of root finding to this form by dividing by the coefficient of $x^3$. The derivative of the polynomial is $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2ax + b$. Now you can write the formula for the solution update: $x_i = x_{i-1} - \\frac{x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c}{3x^2 + 2ax + b}$ for $i > 0$ where $x_0$ is an initial guess (in the example you'll provide it by yourself).

In this example, you are going to find the shortest paths from one vertex to all accessible vertices in a graph. To demonstrate the ability of `pw.iterate` to work on tables with changing sets of rows, the initial answer only contains one vertex - a starting point. It grows when paths to new vertices are found. The graph is finite so the set of vertices finally stops growing and the distances finally stop updating so the iteration can finish.\n",

        "# Bridging Financial Data Streams: A Look at ASOF Join in Pathway\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial provides an in-depth exploration of ASOF joins in pathway. You will learn how to employ this feature to align stock prices and corporate events, showcasing the practicality and efficiency of ASOF joins in financial data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "An ASOF join, is a type of join operation that combines data based on the closest preceding or succeeding timestamp. It is commonly used in realtime streaming data processing frameworks to align and correlate data based on temporal relationships. The term \"ASOF\" stands for \"As-Of,\" indicating that the join operation considers data as of a specific point in time. There are three primary modes of asof join: backward, forward, and nearest.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Backward`: is the default mode, it finds the last row in the other table where the time is less than or equal to the time in the current row of the self table.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Forward`: It finds the next row in the other table where the time is greater than or equal to the time in the current row of the self table.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `Nearest`: This mode identifies the closest time match in the other table, whether it's in the past or future. If two times are equally distant, it defaults to the backward method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![Illustration of ASOF Join](https://pathway.com/assets/content/tutorials/finance_ts_asof_join/asof_join_illustration.png)\n\n",
        "\n",
        "There are few reasons that emphasize its importance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Temporal Alignment**: Realtime data is time-stamped and is often required to be analyzed in conjunction with other time-stamped data. However, these different data streams may not always arrive at exactly the same time. An asof join enables you to combine these different data streams in a time-aware manner, aligning data points that are closest in time, even if they are not exactly the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Data from Different Frequencies**: Realtime data streams can come in different frequencies. For instance, one stream might be generating data every second, while another generates data every minute. An asof join can reconcile these different frequencies by joining on the most recent available data from the less frequent stream.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Realtime Analysis**: Many realtime applications, such as algorithmic trading, IoT analytics, or realtime monitoring, require asof joins to effectively combine and analyze multiple data streams in realtime. For example, in algorithmic trading, traders might need to join realtime trade data with less frequent reference data (like company earnings reports) to make immediate trading decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Resource Optimization**: By performing asof joins, systems can reduce the volume of data that needs to be kept in memory for joining, because you only need to keep the most recent relevant data points. This is especially important for high-throughput realtime systems, where optimizing memory usage can significantly impact system performance and cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective: Unveiling the Impact of Events on Stock Prices\n",
        "\n",
        "The ultimate goal in this tutorial is to unravel the impact of various corporate events on stock prices. To understand this dynamic, you will be combining two separate data sets: one containing key corporate events and the other encapsulating the corresponding stock prices for five major US companies.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, a conventional join operation is insufficient in this context. Why? Because corporate events and stock prices don't align perfectly in time. Corporate events are sporadic, whereas stock prices fluctuate continuously throughout trading hours. To correlate these events with stock prices effectively, you'd need a more sophisticated join operation that can accurately pair an event with the closest corresponding stock price, in terms of timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the scope of this tutorial, you will be leveraging data from a public API in a static mode purely for illustrative purposes. However, a more typical use-case would involve the processing of realtime data streams. In such scenarios, Pathway input connectors come into play, seamlessly integrating with the remaining parts of your code to facilitate uninterrupted data flow and processing. The events data comes with dates instead of datetimes. Hence the choice of daily stock prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "For this tutorial, you would need to have Python installed along with the `pandas`, `yahooquery`, and of course, `pathway` libraries. If you haven't installed these yet, you can do so using pip:"

        "\n",
        "* `*on`: `ColumnExpression`: This represents the list of column expressions that specify the conditions for the join. In our case, we use `events_table.symbol == price_table.symbol` to ensure we're matching events and prices for the same company.\n",
        "\n",
        "* `how`: `JoinMode`: This sets the join mode, which can be `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, or `FULL`. `JoinMode.LEFT` is chosen to retain all rows from `events_table` and attach corresponding data from `price_table` where available.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* `direction`: `Direction`: The direction of the join, either `BACKWARD`, `FORWARD`, or `NEAREST`. We set `direction=Direction.FORWARD` to find the closest subsequent match in `price_table` for each row in `events_table`. This choice aligns with our goal of understanding the future impact of events on stock prices.\n",

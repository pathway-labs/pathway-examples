Events are the core of data streaming architectures and it's important to understand their basic principles so that you can build effective data streaming pipelines. The next section explains some of these principles; you should feel free to skip it if you have a basic understanding of how data streaming works.\n",

        "> When doing 'regular' data-processing in `pandas` you are working with a dataset that is static: all the data you will work with is available to you *before* you start your processing. Sure, it may need some cleaning and wrangling, but your dataset stays more or less the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "> In streaming workflows, this is very different. Data is not static but dynamic. You don't know the size or content of your dataset before you start processing: the processing happens *as* the data is being generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "> This means that we can't structure our processing around 'batches' of data the way we did in `pandas`: the whole point of data streaming is to process data in real-time, not sit around waiting until all of the data has been collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "> So instead, data streaming pipelines are built around 'events': specific moments when something happens to our data. Common events are data being created, removed, or updated. Whenever an event happens, the data streaming pipeline is triggered and data processing starts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, we will create a Pathway table by listening to a directory for new events (in this case `./sum_input_data/`) and defining the schema of the table which maps the columns to their data types. Be sure to toggle streaming mode on by setting `mode` to `streaming`."

        "In this guide, you've mastered the use of the windowby-reduce scheme in the Pathway library, a robust tool for time-series data aggregation. The three types of window functions\u2014session, sliding, and tumbling\u2014have been unveiled, each with its unique way of segmenting data. A playful example of chocolate consumption illuminated their practical application. As you continue to delve into data analysis, check out the tutorial [Detecting suspicious user activity with Tumbling Window group-by](/developers/showcases/suspicious_activity_tumbling_window), which utilizes the tumbling window function to spot unusual user behavior. Continue exploring, and elevate your data analysis prowess."

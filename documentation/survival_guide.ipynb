        "## Streaming and static modes\n",
        "\n",
        "The first thing to keep in mind is that Pathway is made for streaming data.\n",
        "In this **streaming mode**, Pathway assumes unbounded incoming updates.\n",
        "To process the incoming data, Pathway maintains a [computation graph](/developers/documentation/introduction/key-concepts#computation-graph).\n",
        "This mode requires input connectors listening to streaming data sources.\n",
        "The computation runs indefinitely until the process is killed: the computation starts with `pw.run()` and everything afterwards is unreachable code.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the streaming mode may not be the most convenient when testing or debugging.\n",
        "For that purpose, Pathway provides a **static mode** in which static data may be attached to the connectors.\n",
        "In that mode, finite and static data can be loaded, e.g. from a table written in a static csv file or from a markdown table.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the computation is run in the static mode, all the data is loaded and processed at once.\n",
        "While the static mode does not fully benefit from the computation graph, it allows checking if the graph is correctly built.\n",
        "To ease the debugging, Pathway provides a function called `compute_and_print`.\n",
        "When calling `pw.debug.compute_and_print(t)`, Pathway builds the whole graph, ingests all the available static data, prints the obtained table `t`, and then discards the data.\n",
        "Calling twice `compute_and_print` will result in ingesting the whole data twice.\n",
        "In the streaming mode, the building of the graph and the ingestion of the data is done only once when `pw.run()` is called and the data is maintained in the graph until the computation is over: results cannot be printed but should be accessed using output connectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The processing pipeline should be designed in the same way no matter what mode is used in the end. The only difference is how the data is considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn more about both modes, you can read our [article](/developers/documentation/introduction/streaming-and-static-modes) about it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most of our examples, we use the static mode since it avoids setting external streaming data sources such as Kafka."

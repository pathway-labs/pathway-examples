        "Pathway delivers consistent results by explicitly reasoning about time: every processed input message bears a timestamp, and each output message specifies exactly for which input times it was computed. In other words, each output produced by Pathway is the final answer that would have been given if all sources were read up to the indicated cutoff times, and the computation was carried in entirety. No intermediate results are shown. Updates to the outputs will be sent only when new data is input into the system.\n",

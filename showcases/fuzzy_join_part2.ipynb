        "Many matchings can be inferred automatically, but some can be really tricky without help: while the fans of Harry Potter can instantaneously make the connection between 'You-Know-Who' and 'Voldemort', it is impossible for a computer to do so, at least without help.\n",

        "Human audit is unavoidable in many areas such as accounting or banking.\n",
        "As such, we extend our pipeline with an auditor that supervises the process of reconciliation.\n",
